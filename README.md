# Face-Recognition-System

Computers have automated a lot of tasks in our day-to-day activities and have made the life of humans a lot easier. Calling a bell or an alert system has been there for ages. What if we could know who is standing in front of your home even before you answer the door. The project focuses on automating the task of identifying the person who is standing in front of your home and alerts you immediately. In this project we used an ML to train our model. Whenever a person comes in front of the house, then the camera module captures the image of the person. The image is then sent to the server or database and possible matches are found. If a match is found, then a notification appears on the mobile phone through a smartphone. The mobile application is made using Flutter, which is a cross platform app, so that the same app can be used both on android and IOS devices.

The below diagram explains the basic working of our project, staring from capturing the image to finally recognizing and sending the notification.
